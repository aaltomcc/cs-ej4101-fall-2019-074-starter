# What I learned in this course

## The key points I learned from video lectures and other material

When defining DevOps I learned to look the concept from different ways
* Systems thinking highlights to always understand the whole system and then perform global optimizations to reduce lead time
* Feedback loops with proper measurements are key to improvements. They enable continuous improvement and bring principles of Kaizen also in the DevOps context.
* Culture of experimentation is an important enabler for learning and improvement and this culture need to learn from failures.

The CAMS model of DevOps explained to me four important distinct aspects and enablers of successful of DevOps
* Culture is the most important and the most challenging part of DevOps.
* Automation is enabler of efficiency as software development consists of several recurring tasks that are performed faster and more correctly by machines.
* Measurement is key requirement for gaining feedback that is needed for improvement.
* Sharing knowledge is important in any cross functional teams and in DevOps sharing need to be built into culture and practices.

The DevOps redefined some old concepts and introduced new ideas
* Service Ownership has been brought to the level of developers from managerial pyramids.
* Cross-Functional Teams have been brought deeper level with common responsibility and ownership and knowledge sharing practices.
* Hack Events are truly motivating learning events that rarely take place in old traditional companies but would have enormous opportunities for knowledge sharing and collaboration.
* Destructive Testing in real environments bring testing and fault tolerance in new level from being a one-time shot before launch into a continuous improvement activity.

The material also covered several tools related to DevOps. However, the most challenging part was to follow tool details from the videos. On the other hand, the most important message related to tool was that the tools play only helping role in DevOps which is much wider concept as described for example by the CAMS Model. Still it is easy to continue learning evaluating some tools related to containers, configuration management etc.
